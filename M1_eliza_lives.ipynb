    "### Answer: It is very obvious that this Eliza bot is extremely simple and not a complex chatbot meant for large and diverse conversations. While I can see how it seemed super advanced given the technology of the 1960's but in todays world Eliza bot is not even in the same conversation as even the simplest chatbots available. Even the early versions of these chatbots are miles better. This stems from the difference in how their logic is structured. Eliza bot is a very simple way of \"If user says this, say that\" while modern chatbots are trained through rigorous practice and based on probability\n",

    "### The best way I would assume to make this response more human would be to extend the eliza_script.json. Doing this would greatly improve the diversity of conversations that Eliza can give reasonable response back to.\n"
